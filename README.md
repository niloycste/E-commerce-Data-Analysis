# E-commerce-Data-Analysis
# Overview

I leveraged advanced data visualization techniques to extract valuable insights from a comprehensive dataset. By visualizing sales patterns, customer behavior, and product trends, I identified key growth opportunities and provided actionable recommendations to optimize business strategies and enhance overall performance.
Tools Used

     **SQL:** For digging into the structured data stored in our databases. SQL queries help pull out specific information like sales figures, customer demographics, and product performance. It's all about exploring data relationships, aggregating insights, and filtering to get the details needed.

    **Python:** The ace for heavy lifting in data analysis. Using libraries like pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib, I clean up and preprocess the data. Python's seamless integration with SQL databases keeps the flow smooth, allowing seamless interaction with relational databases and keeping the analysis cohesive.
